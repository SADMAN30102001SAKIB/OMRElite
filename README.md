OMRElite: Computer Vision Mobile App for Evaluating OMR/Bubble Sheet Based Exams

After almost 10K+ lines of code, countless sleepless nights, infinite amount of bug/error fixing later, Introducing "OMRElite"!

The app has been in the making for over a month & still going...
The main moto of the app is to reduce the tedious process of evaluating OMR Sheets by hand which is time consuming & might lead to some wrong evaluations. And using a machine is very costly. Also, the report making process is time killing as well.
But this app can do all these in couple of minutes with few clicks of buttons.
How?

Well, it has 3 core features:
I) Creating customizable OMR Sheets (the OMR PDF can be printed for examination)
II) Evaluating those papers with mobile camera in a short amount of time using computer vision
III) Generating customizable report of all evaluated students (available as a PDF or send it to teacher's email as a .csv file)

But there are many minor features as well, like
* If somehow user deletes the PDFs made by the app (mistakenly or to free up storage), then the app can re-generate those PDFs automatically with 1 click of a button.
* If a student mistakenly filled wrong ID number / set, then teacher can manually fix that inside the app.
* There are lots of analysis, like individual student analysis, overall exam analysis. 
* Searching, filtering by name/ID/set etc.

Ummmm, with all these, now it's not even a OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) anymore, right? I think we should call It AMR (Artificial Mark Recognition). JK! But the app has limitations, which I'll try to improve time to time.

All right, now future goals for OMRElite
Major:
1) Integration Database for creating accounts so that users can log in to any device with their credentials & all their previous work will be visible.
2) Create a mechanism for joining students via a "joining code", so that students can join with that "code" & view their own evaluated OMR & overall report.
3) Currently the user has to manually click on capture to get the image. so will try to automate it such a way that the app auto captures the OMR page as soon as the camera detects the page. 
4) Creating a Web Version of the app

Minor:
1) Implement a "recycle bin" feature to safely store deleted exams or student data before permanent deletion.
2) Reduce network latency & improve app performance.
3) Improve the OMR & App designs.
Anyways, in the last couple of months, I've explored a lot about the android Operating System, Computer Vision & Cross-Platform Apps.
It's still under development and I'm continuously learning & researching new things & hoping to make OMRElite better ðŸ’œ.


Currently i'm Planning to build a hardware device for this.
Currently one has to evaluate each paper by holding the phone with hand, which might become overwhelming if the there's a lot of OMR papers (let's say 500+).
So, if there were a machine where one will simply put all the OMR papers & adjust the mobile phone on top that machine in a way that the machine will automatically slide the papers & this app will evaluate each paper one by one, then it'll literally eliminate all human intervention.
The machine & the app will have to work in sync btw.
